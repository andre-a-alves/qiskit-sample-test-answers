A Bell state is one in which two qubits are entangled and there is a 50% probability of each qubit having each value.
Examples of Bell states are a 50% chance for either |00> or |11> or a 50% chance of |01> or |10>.

In Dirac notation, the four Bell states are:
* $|\Phi^{+}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |00\rangle + |11\rangle \right)$
* $|\Phi^{-}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |00\rangle - |11\rangle \right)$
* $|\Psi^{+}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |01\rangle + |10\rangle \right)$
* $|\Psi^{-}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |01\rangle - |10\rangle \right)$
