According to the Qiskit API, 

>The depth of a quantum circuit is a measure of how many “layers” of quantum gates, executed in parallel, it takes to complete the computation defined by the circuit.

Therefore, the depth of this circuit will be how many gates must be executed along the longest (critical) path across the circuit.
