This question focusses on fidelity, which is a measure of how close two quantum states are to each other.
State fidelity, measured by the `state_fidelity` function, measures the fidelity between two quantum states.
Process fidelity, measured by the `process_fidelity` function, measures the fidelity within a quantum channel or operator, and thus measures the noise within that channel or operator.
Average gate fidelity, measured by the `average_gate_fidelity` function, measures the fidelity of multiple gates within a quantum channel.
