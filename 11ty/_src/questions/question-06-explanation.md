This question tests whether on understands the basic gates and the Bloch sphere.

The Hadamard gate performs a rotation of $\pi$ around the $\frac{\hat{x} + \hat{z}}{\sqrt{2}}$ axis.
So from the $|0\rangle$ state, the $H$ gate is equivalent to an $R_{Y}(\frac{\pi}{2})$ gate.
Remember an $R_{\gamma}$ gate will rotate the Bloch vector around the $\gamma$ axis.
