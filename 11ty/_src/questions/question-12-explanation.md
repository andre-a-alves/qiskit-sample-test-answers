This question tests your understanding of the definition of several gates and how they affect the qubit's state.
In particular, for this question you need to know that the $T$ gate is equivalent to half of an $S$ gate.
This is because the $T$ gate, sometimes also called a $\sqrt[4]{Z}$ gate, is equivalent to an $R_{Z}(\frac{\pi}{8})$ gate.
Meanwhile, an $S$ gate, sometimes called a $\sqrt{Z}$ gate is equivalent to an $R_{Z}(\frac{\pi}{4})$ gate.
