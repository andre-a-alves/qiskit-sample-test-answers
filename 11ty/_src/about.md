# About Qiskit Sample Test Answers
[Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) is IBM's open-source SDk for working with quantum computers. In 2021, IBM began offering a certification for [IBM Certified Associate Developer - Quantum Computation using Qiskit v0.2X](https://www.ibm.com/training/certification/C0010300). This page is intended to facilitate studying for the certification exam by giving detailed explanations for the [Qiskit Developer certification](https://www.ibm.com/training/certification/C0010300) exam's sample questions. Eventually, I hope to expand to include additional study questions.
