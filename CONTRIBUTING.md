# Contributing

First, thank you so much for thinking about contributing to this project!
When I was studying for the exam, I wanted a resource like this to help me study, but I could not find one.
Hopefully, this resource can be helpful to anyone who is interested in taking this test.

I also plan to expand this document in the near future.

There are three main ways to contribute:
* [Open an issue](#open-an-issue)
* [Contribute to the Jupyter Notebooks](#contribute-to-the-jupyter-notebookes)
* [Contribute to the website](#contribute-to-the-website)

In all cases, please be respectful of everyone involved in the project and follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Project Structure
This project is made up of a few parts that go together in a particular workflow:
1. The information is contained in Jupyter Notebooks in the `/jupyter/` directory
2. `jupyter nbconvert` is used to convert the notebooks into plain HTML files
3. In the `/11ty/` directory, [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com) is used to generate CSS
4. Also in the `/11ty/` directory, the rest of the site is created using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev)
5. Whenever there is a merge into this repository's `main` branch, a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) builds and deploys the website

Therefore, the project can be thought of as being divided between the Python and the web side, with a touch of CI/CD.

## Contributing to the Codebase
If you wish to contribute to the codebase itself, please follow these steps:
1. Fork the project to your own Github account.
2. Make the changes in a separate branch in your own fork.
3. When you are happy with your changes, make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from your fork's branch to this repository's main branch.

## Contributing
As stated earlier, there are three main ways to contribute.
Since two involve contributing to the codebase, please follow these specific instructions when doing so.

### Open an Issue

The easiest way to contribute is to open an issue.
To do so, just follow the [new issues link](https://github.com/andre-a-alves/qiskit-sample-test-answers/issues/new).
Give the issue a meaningful title, and explain your issue in the comment.
Examples of issues could be:
* Identify a bug
* Ask for a feature on the website
* Give a suggestion for a better explanation to one of the questions

All comments and suggestions are welcome.

### Contribute to the Jupyter Notebookes
Begin by following the directions in the [README](README.md#jupyterlab) for running the project in a JupyterLab.
Once you are happy with your changes, just follow the instruction from [Contributing to the Codebase](#contributing-to-the-codebase) to make a pull request.

### Contribute to the Website
The website is built in [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) with CSS generated by [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com).

After cloning the repo as explained in the [README section on JupyterLab](README.md#jupyterlab), navigate to the `/11ty/` directory.
From there, install the necessary dependencies with `npm install`.

Once the dependancies are installed, you can run a local versin of the website by running the command
```bash
npm run serve
```

This will continuously check for changes to the files that make up the website and regenerate both the CSS and HTML.

Once you are happy with your changes, just follow the instruction from [Contributing to the Codebase](#contributing-to-the-codebase) to make a pull request.
