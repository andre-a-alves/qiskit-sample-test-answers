This repository contains a [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org) containing the following information for each of the questions provided by IBM in their sample test which can be downloaded [here](https://www.ibm.com/training/certification/C0010300):
* The questions and potential answers
* An explanation of the question
* Links to reference materials related to the question
* The correct answer
* An explanation about why each question is correct or incorrect, including code examples

[Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) is IBM's open-source SDk for working with quantum computers.
In 2021, IBM began offering a certification for [IBM Certified Associate Developer - Quantum Computation using Qiskit v0.2X](https://www.ibm.com/training/certification/C0010300).
This repository is intended to facilitate studying for the certification exam.

There are eventual plans to convert these notebooks into a website hosted with GitHub pages.

## Getting Started
To begin, download this repository onto your own system.
There are several ways to do so, but the easiest will be via the command line with the following command: 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:andre-a-alves/qiskit-sample-test-answers.git
```
Next, I highly recommend setting up a virtual environment for this project.
Instructions for how to do so with `venv` are available in [the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

Once you have set up and activated your virtual environment, navigate to the directory containing your local version of this repository.

### Install Dependencies
